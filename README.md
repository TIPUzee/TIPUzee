## Projects

#### 1. [AI-Disease Predictor](http://ec2-18-117-234-244.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/home) `(My Final Year Project)`
An [integrated healthcare platform](http://ec2-18-117-234-244.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/home) aimed at revolutionizing patient care and diagnosis by combining artificial intelligence and medical expertise. Key functionalities include:
- Symptom-based disease prediction with AI-driven potential diagnoses.
- Brain tumor detection and classification through MRI analysis using a sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
- Doctor-patient interaction features, including appointment scheduling and communication through WhatsApp.
- Comprehensive management tools for administrators to handle patient and doctor databases, appointment tracking, and system analytics.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment gateway for patient's to pay to book appointments with a selected doctor on a chosen time slot.

#### 2. Skills Seekho
I developed the complete frontend and backend for [Skills Seekho](https://www.skillsseekho.com), a skills learning platform for students in Pakistan, while working from home for a company located in Lahore. I handled the server and other related tasks, and integrated the [PayFast payment gateway](https://gopayfast.com/) for students to pay and purchase courses. I also developed APIs for mobile apps to use the same backend server.

#### 3. Smart Phone Comparison System
A comprehensive project using Python, Flask, Selenium, and Bootstrap. It allows users to compare different smartphones based on benchmarks from sites like [AnTuTu](https://www.antutu.com), [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com), and [DxOMark](https://www.dxomark.com). The system automatically grabs data from these websites and provides detailed comparisons, helping users decide which phone suits their needs. Users can also prioritize different components like processing power, rear camera quality, selfie camera quality, battery or display etc.

#### 4. Opportunity Hub
A job-finding web application developed using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap. This platform allows companies to post available jobs, and allows jobseekers to apply on these jobs, and also managing their profiles. This platform also allows admins to upload text files containing questions and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with correct answers. Users can take tests and earn badges for their profiles, enhancing their job search experience.

#### 5. Automated Timetable Generator
One of my early projects in C++, this tool generates timetables while solving challenges like avoiding overlapping classroom allocations, ensuring specific lecture allocations for batches and teachers, and optimizing the overall schedule efficiently.

## Competitions
I have actively participated in speed programming competitions, showcasing my problem-solving skills and competitive spirit:
1. In 2022, my university professor encouraged me to participate in the speed programming competition at GIMS PMAS Arid Agriculture University. Despite competing against students with 3 to 4 years of programming experience, I secured the runner-up position with only one year of experience.
2. I was selected to represent my university at the main campus, [PMAS Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi](https://www.uaar.edu.pk/index.php), for another speed programming competition. Competing against top students from various campuses, I once again achieved the runner-up position.
3. To continually improve my problem-solving skills, I regularly solve programming questions on [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), which helps me stay sharp and prepared for future challenges.

## Work Experience
### Freelance Developer
I have been freelancing for universities abroad, handling complex assignments and projects, including:
- C++ complex assignments
- Web designs
- Python projects
- Python Tkinter projects

### CyberCilo Internship
I completed a 3-month internship at CyberCilo, a cybersecurity product development company. As a Python backend developer, I worked on a project named "Web Defacement." This web-based project monitors websites, scrapes their complete data using Selenium WebDriver in Python, and raises alerts for unwanted or unethical changes. During this internship, I gained significant experience working with Ubuntu.

### [SkillsSeekho](https://www.skillsseekho.com) Developer
I worked as a web frontend and backend developer at SkillsSeekho, a skills learning platform, via work from home. I handled all project complexities and served as the main guide and consultant for clients related to technical issues. My responsibilities included:
- Developing the complete frontend and backend of the platform
- Handling server management and related tasks
- Integrating the [PayFast payment gateway](https://gopayfast.com/) for course purchases

## Currently Learning
I am actively learning and working on machine learning projects in Python. I am excited to integrate ML solutions into my future projects and contribute to innovative tech solutions.
