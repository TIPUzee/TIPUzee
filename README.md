# Hi there, I'm Zeeshan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer and a student at [GIMS PMAS Arid Agriculture University](http://www.gims.edu.pk/) Pakistan. I have a strong foundation in backend and frontend technologies, and I am currently diving into the world of machine learning in Python. Below is a summary of my skills, projects, and what I am currently working on.

## Skills
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Flask, Selenium, C++, JavaScript, PHP
- **Databases:** MongoDB, MySQL
- **Frontend Technologies:** Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Angular, jQuery
- **Machine Learning:** Currently learning and working on ML projects in Python

## Projects

### 1. AI-Disease Predictor `(My Final Year Project)`
An integrated healthcare platform aimed at revolutionizing patient care and diagnosis by combining artificial intelligence and medical expertise. Key functionalities include:
- Symptom-based disease prediction with AI-driven potential diagnoses.
- Brain tumor detection through MRI analysis using a sophisticated machine learning algorithm.
- Doctor-patient interaction features, including appointment scheduling and communication through WhatsApp.
- Comprehensive management tools for administrators to handle patient and doctor databases, appointment tracking, and system analytics.

### 2. Smart Phone Comparison System
A comprehensive project using Python, Flask, Selenium, and Bootstrap. It allows users to compare different smartphones based on benchmarks from sites like [AnTuTu](https://www.antutu.com), [Geekbench](https://www.geekbench.com), and [DxOMark](https://www.dxomark.com). The system automatically grabs data from these websites and provides detailed comparisons, helping users decide which phone suits their needs. Users can also prioritize different components like processing power, rear camera quality, selfie camera quality, battery or display etc.

### 3. OpportunityHub
A job-finding web application developed using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap. This platform allows companies to post available jobs, and allows jobseekers to apply on these jobs, and also managing their profiles. This platform also allows admins to upload text files containing questions and multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with correct answers. Users can take tests and earn badges for their profiles, enhancing their job search experience.

### 4. Automated Timetable Generator
One of my early projects in C++, this tool generates timetables while solving challenges like avoiding overlapping classroom allocations, ensuring specific lecture allocations for batches and teachers, and optimizing the overall schedule efficiently.

## Currently Learning
I am actively learning and working on machine learning projects in Python. I am excited to integrate ML solutions into my future projects and contribute to innovative tech solutions.
