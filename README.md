One of my early projects in C++, this tool generates timetables while solving challenges like avoiding overlapping classroom allocations, ensuring specific lecture allocations for batches and teachers, and optimizing the overall schedule efficiently.

## Competitions
I have actively participated in speed programming competitions, showcasing my problem-solving skills and competitive spirit:
1. In 2022, my university professor encouraged me to participate in the speed programming competition at GIMS PMAS Arid Agriculture University. Despite competing against students with 3 to 4 years of programming experience, I secured the runner-up position with only one year of experience.
2. I was selected to represent my university at the main campus, [PMAS Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi](https://www.uaar.edu.pk/index.php), for another speed programming competition. Competing against top students from various campuses, I once again achieved the runner-up position.
3. To continually improve my problem-solving skills, I regularly solve programming questions on [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), which helps me stay sharp and prepared for future challenges.

## Work Experience
### Freelance Developer
I have been freelancing for universities abroad, handling complex assignments and projects, including:
- C++ complex assignments
